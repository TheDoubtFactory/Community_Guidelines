# Contributing to a Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my project! 

I value a positive and respectful community, and I kindly ask that you follow our code of conduct in all interactions with other members. Please take a moment to review our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and help me maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors.

To ensure that your contributions are noticed and properly addressed, I recommend following the guidelines below. These guidelines can also help you find and work on issues more efficiently.

Thank you for taking the time to read and follow these instructions.

## How to contribute

If you find one of my projects interesting and would like to contribute by solving an issue, here are the steps you can take:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes. 
   - This branch should be based on the branch where the issue you are solving is located (this will avoid merge conflicts).
3. Make changes to the code in your branch.
4. If there are multiple files being affected, provide individual commit messages to inform the changes.
5. Ensure that your code adheres to the [coding standards](#Guidelines-for-contributions) of the community.
6. Prepare the pull requests as in the [Guidelines for contributions](#Guidelines-for-contributions)
7. Link the pull request to the issue you are addressing by mentioning the issue number in the pull request description.
8. Comment on the issue referencing the pull request.
9. Request that the pull request be merged into the branch where the issue is located.
10. Submit the pull request.

## Guidelines for contributions

Please make sure that your code is well-documented and easy to understand. Specifically:
- Write clear and concise comments and docstrings.
- Follow standard conventions for your language of choice (such as PEP8 in Python).
- Format your code for readability.
- Make sure that your pull request addresses only one issue or feature.
- If you are submitting a pull request for something where an issue does not exist, then create an issue first and reference it in your pull request.
- If you are submitting a pull request for a feature, provide a detailed description of the feature and explain why it is necessary.
- If you are submitting a pull request for a bug fix, please provide a detailed description of how your fix addresses it.
